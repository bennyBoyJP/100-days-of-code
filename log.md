# Round 4 - 100 Days Of Code - Log

(continuing from Round 4 Day 52, see previous entries on twitter at @Bennyboy_JP)
### Day 52: December 21, 2020
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Made a little oribiting animation using Pygame. Link:

**Thoughts:** Tried to get my head around trees and recursion on "Monster Messages" - Day 19 - Advent of Code 2020 https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/19 Still a lot to learn about different data structures, how they operate and how they're constructed.

### Day 53: December 22, 2020
**Today's Progress**: More shape drawing. It's fun to play with the variables.

This simple algorithm keeps the shapes growing and shrinking back and forth:

if x > 500:
  switch = 0
elif x < 0:
  switch = 1

if switch = 1:
  x += 1
elif switch = 0:
  x -= 1
